You can grab the html of a website, but what if you only want the recipe?

![Website example](https://i.imgur.com/fjr0M6H.jpg?1)

## How it works

First it grabs the Markdown-formatted text of the html page using [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text). 

It evalutes the number of 'cooking' related words in each line and pulls out the peak.

It does the same for extracting the ingredient list.

Then it scans the directions and the ingredient list to determine what the *actual* baking time would be and gives that estimate.

## Example

Grab the recipe shown above from the JSON database (recipe #144,253).

```bash
python extract_recipe.py http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/sidedishes/roasted-sweet-potatoes-with-toasted-walnuts-honey-and-goat-cheese/
```

Output:

```bash
